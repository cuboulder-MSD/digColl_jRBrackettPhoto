Note that there is a discrepancy between the labeled ""02"" (1902) and my conclusion that the picture was taken in June of 1898. The auditorium may be complete so that my conclusion about its being under construction is wrong, or negatives and envelopes have been accidentally switched in the past.

Two men walking in front. This picture was taken from old Engineering because a corner of the brick gym can be seen at the extreme left. This is not quite the same view as 4-3. Here the camera was a few feet south of the view 4-3. The Chautauqua Auditorium is completed and the tree in front of the right pair of arched windows has grown about a foot. This would suggest this was taken in the summer of 1899 or 1900. Notice the changes in the utility pole by the walk at the left. In 4-3 it had four crossarms and a transformer and only two light supply wires from the right. In 4-4 the supply has been increased to four heavy wires, and two crossarms and the transformer have been removed from the pole. Mt. St. Gertrude Academy building is visible at the far right. To the right of the two men a utility trench has been recently excavated and two black pipes stand up. They may be water valves. Two stone steps for alighting from carriages are visible - one for the gym and one for chemistry. Note the discrepancy between the labeled ""Oct 03"" and my estimate of 1899-1900. My estimate was based on the conclusion that the Chautauqua Auditorium in 4-3 was still under construction. If that is in error then my estimated dates for these two are in error. The fence around Gamble Field appears in 4-3 and 4-4 which probably would seem to put these after 1900. The condition of the Chautauqua Auditorium in 4-3 with big holes where the windows should be is a puzzle.

Note the hanging lamp beautifully silhouetted in the second main floor window from the right. This shows the original configuration of the south ground floor doors and windows before the entrance was remodeled in 1910. There are two doorways reached by sunken steps. One is partially hidden by the tree. Between are two regular windows and a narrow slot window. Projecting downward out of the slot is a box out of which comes a U-shaped metal bracket. This is probably for a heliostat for physics. The U-shaped bracket carried a mirror which was rotated by a clockwork to ""follow the sun"" and provide a beam of sunlight in a laboratory for optical studies. The angle support is parallel to the earth's axis of rotation.

Plowed fields, wire fences and dirt paths wander in and out. At the right is a two span wooden bridge over Boulder Creek approximately where the Folsom (24th) Street Bridge is today. To the left of it is the wooden tower of a nearby oil well. A second oil well is to the left and a third (?) may be seen beyond the second. Corn shocks are In the field to the left of the oil wells. At the hospital a man is doing something at the near side door, two people are sitting in the late afternoon sun on the second floor of the porch. A large clothesline is west of the building and on it it looks like a large robe, three blankets and underwear. The roof of some kind of square out-building is to the left of the clothes¬line. The roof of the hospital shows two distinct textures and the brace for the left chimney is in place. A deep trench across the picture is the cut in which the railroad crossed the campus. The rails can't be seen. A board walk from the front door of the hospital passes through a gate where new trees are planted, crosses the road where it forks, and goes down steps to the railroad grade. A horse and cart are stopped at the walk crossing. The cart is a funny two wheel cart with the driver standing up at the rear with a canopy over his head. He may be waiting for the upbound team and wagon which is blurred. One of the ornamental towers of Old Main is seen at the lower right, and through the trees at the left a young couple are strolling.","It suddenly dawned on me that this picture which J.R.B. dated ""02"" was most probably taken on Oct. 4, 1902. J.R.B. was on the east roof of Main on the late afternoon of Oct. 4, 1902, when he took pictures 2-k and 2-5 of the Nebraska Football game. After the game was over he took 1-5 of the Anatomy Building. No. 1-5 is not dated, but one can clearly identify wagons, etc. from the game pictures as being in 1-5. The shadows are already quite long in 1-5 as they are here so I'm quite certain that after he took 1-5 he moved his camera around to the N.E. corner of the east roof of Main to take this last picture of the day.

The drawn blinds would be logical for 314 because it has windows on the south which would let in glaring sunshine for a picture such as this.

Two teardrop electric lights in massive brass sockets are dangling from old twisted cord.

On the right board is a quotation or paraphrase, probably from Xenophon, ""But I am on the side of the gods and good men."" The map in the center of the board shows the ""Route of the Ten Thousand,"" and ""Menon's Route into Cilicia"" with distances given in ""English Miles"", ""Greek Stadia"", and ""Persian Parasangs"". This refers to the Expedition of the Ten Thousand which Xenophon describes in the Anabasis and the six maps across the top of the board describe military actions in this campaign against the Persians. The chair arms seem to be covered with carved initials and messages but they have no inkwells. There seems to be a slat missing in the front of the desk. The wooden floor has rather generous cracks and the paneling below the blackboards seems to be cracked and irregular. A grille for a radiator is behind the desk. The writing surfaces of the boards are cracked as though they were a composition surface rather than slate. There is a thermometer attached to the left board in the upper left hand corner, and there is a pull-down device (probably a projection screen) at the left. The door at left has a white porcelain door¬knob. The rectangular opening below the board at the left is a puzzle. It might be a hot air register - with the grille missing - with the short rope handle controlling a damper. The table on which the camera was mounted was apparently placed on top of the chairs - and is visible in the foreground.

It is not known why the celebration was a year late. One can guess that what is shown here is the University's display in Colorado's pavilion at this exhibition. The negative is spotted and deteriorated but a great deal can be identified. The portrait at the upper right is James H. Baker who had just become president of the University on January 1, 1892. It appears on page 148 of ""Glory Colorado"". At the upper left is a picture of a 14-man instrumental singing group (the Glee and Mandolin Club) dressed in formal attire and posed in the President's office in Old Main. Mosaic photos of University scenes can be identified. To the right is a l4-man ""UC"" athletic team. One man holds a ball that could be a basketball or a soccer ball. It is like the football team shown on page 68 of ""Glory Colorado"". At the top is a banner ""The University of Colorado"" and at the bottom center is a view of the University from the north that was very common. It shows Woodbury, Main, Hale, the President's house, and Mt. St. Gertrude Academy - which puts it after about 1892-93 when Hale was built and it does not show the Chautauqua Auditorium which was built in 1898. There are then 36 more pictures in groups of 12 in three large frames. On 5/3/1973 I found the 36 pictures of this display, each mounted on heavy cardboard, in the files of the University Museum. Some are badly faded but they can be clearly identified as these even though the nice labels here have been removed. Several of the pictures shown here are Brackett photos from this collection as identified above. Their appearance here gives a very clear criterion for dating all that appear here. They could not have been taken later than early 1893. In fact, two - the President's Office 23-1 and Law School (interior) 14-1 - can be clearly identified as being taken in February 1893 which suggests that Brackett may have been charged with taking a large number of pictures of the University specifically for this display. Thus many of the interior scenes may have been taken close to February 1893. The view of the University from the north with the University Seal is probably the picture that is hanging in the shop-office of the University locksmith, Verne Miles, in the stadium. The picture that Verne has is the same photographic view as shows here but Verne's picture has been framed without the large white mask which shows here. The University Seal, which was intro¬duced by President Baker at Commencement in 1893 (G.C. pg 107), is loose in the lower left corner of the picture Verne has. Verne says that he found the picture discarded in a trash can in Macky some years ago.",,Law Lecture Room,relatedTo,arbrack1401.tif,http://cudl.colorado.edu/luna/servlet/s/4z991d,President's Office -- Main,relatedTo,arbrack2301.tif,http://cudl.colorado.edu/luna/servlet/s/ow4vx4,,,,,,,,,,,,,"The organization that has made the Item available believes that the Item is in the Public Domain under the laws of the United States, but a determination was not made as to its copyright status under the copyright laws of other countries.

The University did not open until September 5, 1877, and that winter 1877-78 the slate was replaced with Cedar shingles. The picture could only have been taken in the summer of 1876 or 1877.

It shows James H. Baker's office, Room 108, on the NW corner of the main floor of Old Main in February 1893 showing very clearly what was needed to administer a university. This is one of the pictures JRB took for the University's display in the Columbian Exposition. The calendar is turned to February 1893 and is from the ""Mutual Life Insurance Company"" which is observing its ""Semicentennial 1843-1893"" and which is represented by ""Richard A. McCurdy."" Above the roll top desk across the room is a frame of 12 interior pictures of campus buildings. The top left looks like the chapel. The other top ones are the DeLong Math room (209) but the pictures are not from this set, i.e., 14-3 does not appear here. The frame at the right has 12 exterior pictures which are held in with thumb tacks but the pictures are warped and bowed. The views are easily identified from left to right, top to bottom, (Main in the distance, the President's house at right), (Old Main), (Univ. Lake), (Lake and President's house), (Main - identical with second one above), (construction of Woodbury - this is an earlier picture than on pg. 63 of Glory Colorado), (Woodbury), (the President's house and Main), (Cottage No. 1), (Cottage No. 2), (the Anatomy building), (the Medical building without its west wing). The frame over the desk is simlar to the top center one in 14-6 and the frame at right is probably the one at lower left in 14-6. It is quite possible that these frames were taken from the President's office and had new pictures mounted in them for the Columbian Exposition of 14-6. The floor has carpet, the walls have wainscotting, like that in 14-5, and the ceiling has a spiral pattern wall paper. The door has a porcelain doorknob with a key¬lock below It and an eye for fastening it open below and to the right of the knob. The door has three large hinges and opens inward. There is a transom window but no hardware for adjusting it is visible. The top seems to be tipped outward toward the corridor. It seems odd that the occupant of the room could not adjust the transom from within the room. The four bulb light fixture is on a pipe from the ceiling. It may be adjustable in height by rotating the lower part causing the helical center pipe to screw into or out of the pipe above it. The globes are snapped on independently by a flat rotary knob like today's fixtures. The bulb at right is lighted. The heavy ornate center table has twin wheel casters on each foot. The feet are badly scarred and scratched. The top might be leatherpulled over the edges and anchored under the strips of wood. The typewriter says ""Remington Standard Typewriter No. 2"" across the base and it looks as though the carriage return arm is on the right! On the center of the table are a small book, two or three bottles of ink and two pens, while on the far corner is a big steel press probably for imprinting the seal of the University. The table has two locked drawers at the left. The far roll top desk is full of all sorts of papers and on the desk are a horizontal rack for holding pens, two glass inkwells, and a bowl with a sponge which is kept wet for sealing envelopes. Through the door at the left is the outer office (Room 109). A book and box are on the table, a coat and derby hat are on hooks on the long coat rack on the wall. The outer office may not be carpeted. On the wall to the left of the door is ""Nell's Topographical (?) Map of the State of Colorado"" which Is indicative of a period in which the President (Baker) and the University had a very great concern for the people and the State which he and the University served. On the wall at the left is a phone - with two bells near the top, a hanging earpiece on the near side and the mouthpiece was apparently the hole In the lower box which is partly hidden by the hanging earpiece. Shutters can be seen In the window at left. Below and wider than the window and Immediately above the roll top desk is a massive frame with a corrugated front that probably rolls up like the roll top desk. It has two lifting hooks at the bottom -the far one is reflected in the shiny metal. I have no idea what this is for.

The best clue as to the date is the absence of the large square brick smoke stack on the back of the Engineering building. All that is seen is a smaller stack. The big one was apparently removed around 1910 when power generation was moved from the Engineering building to the new heating plant (which is still in use in 1973). S. Mandel in ""Proud Past - Bright Future"" pg. 66, says that the class of 1911 was the last to graduate in Chautauqua and after that the graduations were held in Macky. So this could be around 1912. It is taken from a main floor window of the library (now the Little Theater) whose steps are here crowded. The lamps on the steps have globes - which are absent in earlier pictures. Most of the people in the parade are women although a number of faces are blurred making identity difficult. The people at the head of the line are in black robes with mortar board hats - hence the suggestion that this may be a graduation parade. All the women in white suggest it may be a May Day parade and this is supported by the distant group of women in white who appear to be holding arches of flowers. The time of day is about 2 or 3 p.m. The irrigation ditch is just north of the main sidewalk as it is today. The crowd is separated by the sidewalk because the people on the right are standing on the terrace to see over the heads of those below. It looks as though a couple of photographers are out in the center of the quadrangle. To the right of the marching group are several metal poles about 10 feet high that support two wires. One wire has light bulbs in it in white porcelain sockets. One pole is at the lower left and one can trace the poles and lights all the way back to the arched doorway of the gym. These bulbs are all in series rather than in parallel. To the left of the gym is the small white building which is the railroad station. One man is standing and one is seated by the station. The tracks are visible on the other side of the station. To the left of the station and by the Engineering building is a steel arch frame outlined in light bulbs which shows in other pictures of the Engineering building. This view today would show Norlin Library standing where Engineering and the gym stand. There is a possibility that this shows the same event as is shown on pg. 3 of the Alumni News August 1973 which is there dated as as the May Day Fete May 3, 1913. In that picture the last coed in cap and gown has her mortar board hat tipped backward at a jaunty angle as does the last girl here. In that picture there is a man in black and two women in grey walking west toward the photographer on the main sidewalk. These could be the three people clustered immediately behind a small tree near the right. However, in that picture one sees one pole and its string of overhead lights which seems to be only a foot or two north of the line of small trees while here the poles appear to be 20 or more feet north of the trees.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"The organization that has made the Item available believes that the Item is in the Public Domain under the laws of the United States, but a determination was not made as to its copyright status under the copyright laws of other countries.

Macky seems to fit the 1911 description here. To the right of Macky one can see the railroad tracks. From the highest tower of Hale it looks as though a large radio antenna consisting of two wires separated by a bar swing downward to the left. In front of Macky is the nurses residence but the building called the isolation ward or pest house which was located between the hospital and the nurses home Is not present. The small cellar just north of the hospital is visible. Hospital laundry is drying on the line west of the hospital and the hospital has a large sloping ramp-like fire escape on Its north side. In front of Woodbury is a large vertical mast of a heavy crane. The boom of the crane can be seen sticking out of the trees at a 45° angle. This may have been for unloading stone for construction of Macky, although pictures of the early construction show a railroad siding immediately north of the building. To the right of the crane are a couple of low structures in the trees. It is hard to make out what they are. The east wing Is not on the hospital, the roof and dormers are not in the Woodbury roof.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"The organization that has made the Item available believes that the Item is in the Public Domain under the laws of the United States, but a determination was not made as to its copyright status under the copyright laws of other countries.
